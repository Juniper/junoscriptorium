/*
 * Author        : Curtis Call
 * Version       : 1.41
 * Last Modified : November 25, 2009
 * Platform      : all
 * Release       : 9.6 and above
 *
 * Description   : This is a fully functional 350-point version of the classic
 * Colossal Cave Adventure game - written in SLAX as a Junos op script.
 *
 * Depending on your Junos version, the script might be susceptible to various
 * memory leaks.  When the memory reaches > 50M a warning will be displayed and
 * the memory size will begin to be shown as part of the prompt.  After ~133M
 * the script will crash.  It is best to 'quit' the game before reaching that point.
 * The game can then be restarted and by typing 'restore' the prior game reloaded.
 * No penalty will be applied to points for games that were quit and later restarted.
 *
 * Due to PR 473816, it is best to always append '| no-more' when invoking the
 * script.  Otherwise, long outputs might be truncated by the input prompt.
 *
 * The game can be played simultaneously by multiple users, but each Junos user
 * can have only a single running game at a time.  The game is saved automatically
 * to the SNMP Utility MIB and can be retrieved later by using the 'restore'
 * command.
 *
 * This game makes heavy usage of the SNMP Utility MIB.  If you wish to remove
 * all MIB instances related to the game then use the "clear mib" command at the
 * script prompt.  This will erase all game data (All instances that start with
 * AD!C# and AD!P#) and will quit the game.
 *
 * Revisions:
 *    1.1 - Changed all jcs:execute() function calls for <command> rpcs to use
 *    jcs:invoke() instead due to PR 478080.
 *    1.2 - Fixed comments that were referring to incorrect SLAX quote PR.
 *    1.3 - PR 471625 was fixed in Junos 10.2 and above so the adv:random-number()
 *    function has been modified to use only the math:random() function when the game
 *    is played on 10.2+, otherwise the workaround remains in place.
 *    1.4 - Memory leak PRs have been resolved.  The memory usage will no longer be
 *    displayed in the prompt until the memory size exceeds 50 megs.  Also various
 *    edits were made to comments, text, as well as the license.
 *    1.41 - Converted to UNIX newlines.
